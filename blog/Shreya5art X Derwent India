It was such a huge opportunity for an artist like me I instantly agreed. A lot of people now ask me that how it happened and I just don’t know what to answer. It just happened. I was doing my work honestly and the opportunity knocked my door itself. Sometimes things just fall into place. I was working with graphite and charcoal for about 5 years and in 2020 I suddenly decide to go with colours. And a year later derwent decides to launch their colour pencil range and co incidentally finds my page. What would you call it? My destiny? Luck? Or result of 7 years of pure hardwork? It’s upto you!</p><p class="wireframe p span">I got to know that chromaflow pencils had only 24 shades. It was challenging for me because I started colour pencils with 60 shades. I was new to colour pencils and the stakes were high. For the very first time I was going to work with a brand and that too a brand like derwent. But backing out was not an option. I was in the stage of my drawing journey where I would just do anything..like anything!</p><h3 class="wireframe heading _3">Date</h3><p class="wireframe p span">I received a big box full of the colour pencil and a lot of accessories from derwent. I just didn’t know how to feel. Seeing all the beauty all at once in my little hands. Art supplies are expensive and I used to buy only necessary items to save money. I was so so so happy seeing all those beautiful boxes.<br>I created 6 artworks in two months to review the colour pencils.I was not really satisfied with the first drawing that I created. I believed I could do better so I invested a lot of time in finding a better reference and then I found the ‘one’. I went for a slightly bigger paper.<br>I chose every referenc to create what I can the best. I made each drawing giving my two hundred percent. For me it was not a job to be done but an opportunity to shine. I wanted to give my unique touch to a review based collabs like these. I sticked to what I do the best- detailed portraits and tried to show what these pencils can do. I gave this collab my everything. Choosing the reference was solely my choice and I still went for the most challenging and detailed ones. I exhausted myself to complete the collab on time as some of the drawings because of the complexity took more time than available. But this ended on a great note. </p><p class="wireframe p span">So Derwent India loved working with me and insisted on extending the collaboration. I was so so so happy. I can not explain the feeling.  Getting appreciation from people is one thing and when a reputed brand appreciate your works its a whole different sense of achievement.</p></div><div class="wireframe row"><h2 class="wireframe heading _2">Chapter II</h2><p class="wireframe p span">So the new contract required me to make 18 drawings for derwent. It was valid for the whole year and I was directed to work with the medium as instructed.</p><h3 class="wireframe heading _3">Graphic pencils ( 9h - 98 )</h3><p class="wireframe p span"></p></div></div></section><section class="wireframe section justify-align extended"><div class="wireframe row"></div><div class="wireframe row"><div class="wireframe col auto"><a class="wireframe row" href="index.html">Home</a><a class="wireframe row" href="gallery.html">Gallery</a><a class="wireframe row" href="order.html">Order</a><a class="wireframe row" href="tools.html">Tools</a><a class="wireframe row" href="shop.html">Shop</a><a class="wireframe row" href="blog.html">Blog</a><a class="wireframe row" href="contact.html">Contact</a><a class="wireframe row" href="about.html">About</a></div><div class="wireframe col auto"></div><div class="wireframe col auto"></div><div class="wireframe col auto"><a class="wireframe row" href="track">Track</a><a class="wireframe row" href="faqs">FAQs</a><a class="wireframe row" href="reviews">Reviews</a><a class="wireframe row" href="">Advertise</a><a class="wireframe row" href="undefined">Videos</a></div><div class="wireframe col auto"><a class="wireframe row" href="undefined">Instagram</a><a class="wireframe row" href="undefined">Facebook</a><a class="wireframe row" href="undefined">Twitter</a><a class="wireframe row" href="undefined">Youtube</a><a class="wireframe row" href="undefined">Telegram</a></div></div><span class="wireframe span row">© Shreya5art 2015-2023 | All Rights Reserved</span><a class="wireframe row" href="https://trijyas.in">Developed by Trijyas.in</a></section></body>
